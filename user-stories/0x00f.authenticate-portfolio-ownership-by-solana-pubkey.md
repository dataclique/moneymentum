# Authenticate Portfolio Ownership By Solana Pubkey

As a user, I want to authenticate cryptographically with a Solana wallet so that
my portfolio can be identified by my public key.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The user can sign in by proving control of a Solana public key using a
      Sign-In With Solana (SIWS) style challenge.
- [ ] The signature challenge cannot be replayed. The binding mechanism is
      embedding the requesting address inside the challenge message itself: the
      client requests a nonce by sending the address it intends to sign with;
      the server returns a message of the form "Sign this nonce
      <random-nonce> for address <address>" where `<random-nonce>` is a
      single-use, cryptographically random value with a 5-minute expiry; the
      server stores the nonce as `(nonce, issuedAt, expiresAt, used)` until
      consumption. Verification steps: (1) reject if the nonce is unknown,
      expired, or already marked `used`; (2) parse the address from the signed
      message; (3) verify the signature against the parsed address; (4) reject
      if the parsed address does not match the address the client claims to sign
      as; (5) atomically mark the nonce `used` before issuing a session.
- [ ] Sign-in supports the wallets the app already integrates with (e.g.
      Phantom, Solflare) and surfaces clear errors for signature rejection and
      wallet disconnection.
- [ ] Sessions have an explicit lifetime and refresh policy: session TTL is 24
      hours; refresh tokens are valid for 30 days and silently renew the session
      as long as the refresh token has not expired; once the refresh token
      expires the user must re-sign a fresh SIWS challenge to reauthenticate;
      sessions are scoped per device, each device receives an independent
      session ID, and revocation is performed via a server-side revoke API that
      invalidates a specific session ID and adds the associated refresh token to
      a server-maintained blacklist consulted on every renewal.
- [ ] The portfolio identifier is the authenticated Solana public key.
- [ ] The app stores portfolio metadata under that identifier. "Portfolio
      metadata" is a defined schema covering at least: portfolio settings (e.g.
      target beta, risk preferences), positions split into staged drafts and
      current/active positions, snapshot policy (latest-only or timestamped
      historical snapshots), and user preferences (UI theme, notification
      settings). Backend persistence and frontend state share this contract.
- [ ] Signing in does not require deposit or trading authority.
