# Deposit Into Vault

As a user, I want to deposit USDC into a Moneymentum vault from my Solana wallet
so that my capital is allocated by the vault strategy without giving up custody.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The user can deposit USDC from a connected Solana wallet into the vault.
- [ ] The deposit flow shows current NAV and the share conversion rate before
      submission.
- [ ] Successful deposits mint share tokens visible in the user's wallet and
      portfolio view.
- [ ] Failed deposits surface the on-chain error and do not leave stale UI
      state.
- [ ] The deposit UI works against the devnet program before mainnet rollout.
