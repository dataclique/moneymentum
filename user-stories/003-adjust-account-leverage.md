# Adjust Account Leverage

As a user, I want to be able to adjust cross-account leverage so that total
target notional scales up or down while preserving portfolio weights.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The current cross-account leverage is visible near the portfolio controls.
- [x] The user can change leverage with a slider.
- [x] The user can type an exact leverage value.
- [x] Leverage is constrained to the supported account-level range. The slider,
      the text input, and the rebalance payload all read from one source:
      `LEVERAGE_MIN`, `LEVERAGE_MAX`, and `LEVERAGE_STEP` come from the venue
      configuration the backend already loads, not UI-only defaults. Typed input
      and slider changes are normalized with `roundToStep(value, LEVERAGE_STEP)`
      then `clamp(value, LEVERAGE_MIN,
      LEVERAGE_MAX)` using integer-tick
      math to avoid float drift.
- [x] Changing leverage recalculates target notional from account value times
      leverage.
- [x] Changing leverage preserves active position weights.
- [x] The staged changes panel shows leverage changes relative to the loaded
      exchange state.
