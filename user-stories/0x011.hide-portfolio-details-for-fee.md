# Hide Portfolio Details For A Fee

As a user, I want to hide my portfolio details for a fee so that strangers
cannot inspect my full positions and risk metrics just by knowing my public key.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A portfolio owner can mark detailed portfolio breakdowns as private.
- [ ] Public visitors see only the allowed summary for private portfolios.
- [ ] Privacy is enforced server-side, not just in the UI: backend endpoints
      that return positions, risk metrics, or other detailed portfolio data
      (including full positions and risk metrics) verify the requester is the
      owner or has approved access, and respond with 401/403 or a reduced
      summary payload for non-owners. UI gating is a convenience layer on top of
      this enforcement, never a substitute. Tests cover this authorization for
      both unauthenticated visitors and authenticated non-owners on every detail
      endpoint.
- [ ] The UI explains whether a portfolio is public or private.
- [ ] The fee requirement is explicit before privacy is enabled.
