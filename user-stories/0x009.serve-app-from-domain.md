# Serve The App From A Domain

As a user, I want to go to a domain instead of a random IP address so that the
platform feels stable and easy to return to.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The production domain is defined in checked-in configuration.
- [ ] TLS configuration for the production domain is defined in checked-in
      configuration.
- [ ] Frontend configuration uses the domain as the canonical app URL.
- [ ] Backend API calls from the domain are allowed by checked-in CORS or proxy
      configuration.
- [ ] The README documents the domain and the raw IP fallback behavior.
