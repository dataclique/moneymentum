# Moneymentum Frontend

React + TypeScript trading dashboard built with Vite, TailwindCSS 4, and Radix UI.

## Development

```bash

bun --cwd frontend run build  # Production build
bun --cwd frontend run lint   # Lint check
bun --cwd frontend run test   # Run tests
```

## Design Philosophy

The prototype dashboard targets professional institutional traders. Design decisions
prioritize information density and operational efficiency over aesthetic polish.

### Information Density

Screen real estate is precious. Every element must earn its space:

- Single-character badges (`L`/`S`) instead of verbose labels
- Metrics in compact layouts with aligned columns
- Features collapsed into dropdowns until needed

### Risk Management First

Global leverage is a core feature, not a nice-to-have. Traders scale risk
by adjusting leverage while keeping portfolio composition intact. The formula
`notional = NAV x weight x leverage` ensures proportional scaling.

### Flexibility Over Assumptions

Factor exposures (beta to BTC, beta to SPY) are user-configurable. Different
strategies require different benchmarks. The dashboard should not impose
hardcoded assumptions about what factors matter.

### Consistency

Same information, same format. Numbers align. Badges have uniform width.
Child rows match parent styling patterns. Visual consistency reduces
cognitive load.
