# Protect Invalid Rebalances

As a user, I want to be prevented from submitting invalid rebalances so that I
do not send orders that the venue will reject or that contradict the target
portfolio model.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Rebalance is blocked when account value is unavailable or zero.
- [x] Rebalance is blocked when total target notional is below the venue
      minimum.
- [x] Rebalance is blocked when selected positions cannot each satisfy the
      minimum notional.
- [x] Rebalance is blocked when total weights exceed
      `1 + REBALANCE_MAX_DEVIATION` (default `REBALANCE_MAX_DEVIATION = 0.01`,
      i.e. 101%).
- [x] Rebalance is blocked when total weights fall below
      `1 - REBALANCE_MIN_DEVIATION` (default `REBALANCE_MIN_DEVIATION = 0.01`,
      i.e. 99%).
- [x] Positions below `MIN_NOTIONAL` (venue-supplied per symbol) show an inline
      warning.
- [x] Non-precise mode blocks per-position changes below `MIN_CHANGE_PERCENT`
      (default `0.5%`) and explains that precise mode can be used. All
      thresholds are defined as a single set of constants shared by the
      rebalancer UI, the submit validation, and the tests so the source of truth
      never drifts.
- [x] Blocking reasons are visible near the portfolio controls.
