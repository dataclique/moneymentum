# Trade Hyperliquid Spot Positions

As a user, I want to manage spot positions on Hyperliquid alongside perps so
that my full Hyperliquid book is rebalanced together rather than as two separate
workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Spot symbols appear in the screener alongside perps.
- [ ] The portfolio view distinguishes spot from perp positions.
- [ ] Combined notional and weight calculations include both instrument types.
- [ ] A single rebalance action stages and executes trades across spot and
      perp. Partial execution is handled deterministically: if a spot or perp
      leg partially fills, fails, or is rejected, the system records the
      filled and remaining quantities, attempts the configured compensating
      action or retries permitted by the instrument's venue rules, leaves
      portfolio state internally consistent (the rebalance is marked
      `partial` with a structured failure reason), and emits an alert plus
      operator-facing remediation guidance so the residual exposure can be
      reconciled.
- [ ] Venue rules that differ between spot and perp (minimums, no leverage on
      spot) are respected per instrument.
