# Verify Deployed Hyperliquid Long-Short Rebalancing

As a user, I want to put up a long-short portfolio on Hyperliquid from the
deployed app so that I can manage real positions without running the project
locally.

## Acceptance Criteria

All deployed verification runs against a designated low-risk test account (or
testnet-equivalent where Hyperliquid offers one) with explicit, documented
funding caps; live-fund verification only proceeds with prior approval and a
documented rollback path.

Each criterion below names the deliverable type, the pass/fail signal, and the
failure modes the verification must cover. "Automated smoke test" means a CI job
runnable against the deployed app; "runbook" means a checked-in document with
explicit steps. Failure modes must produce visible, actionable error states in
the deployed app, not silent failures.

- [ ] **Automated smoke test** for deployed wallet connection (test account
      only). Passes when the wallet signs a known test message and the signature
      verifies. Failure modes verified: wallet provider rejection, user
      cancellation, and connection timeout each surface a distinct error message
      in the UI.
- [ ] **Automated smoke test** that the deployed app loads Hyperliquid account
      value and positions for the test account. Passes when the response returns
      a non-zero account value and a positions list (possibly empty) consistent
      with the venue. Failure modes verified: Hyperliquid API unavailability and
      rate-limit responses produce a degraded state with retry guidance rather
      than a crash.
- [ ] **Automated smoke test** that a user can construct long and short target
      positions within the documented funding cap. Passes when the staged
      portfolio shows at least one long and one short with non-zero quantities,
      weights summing to one within `REBALANCE_MAX_DEVIATION`, and side labels
      matching the input. Failure modes verified: insufficient margin and
      invalid weights produce inline validation errors before submission is
      allowed.
- [ ] **Automated smoke test** that staged trades appear before submission, each
      row showing quantity, side, and estimated cost. Passes when the preview
      enumerates one row per changed position.
- [ ] **Runbook** for verifying that rebalance submission works from the
      deployed app, with the test-mode toggle enforced so live funds cannot be
      used unintentionally. Passes when the submission returns transaction
      hashes for every staged order and each transaction is included in a block
      with success status. Failure modes documented: network failures during
      submission, partial fills, and Hyperliquid rejection each have a named
      recovery step (retry, cancel, or close).
- [ ] **Runbook** for verifying that positions refresh after rebalance. Passes
      when post-refresh positions match the submitted targets within a
      documented tolerance (default `0.5%` of notional per position). Failure
      modes documented: slippage or partial fills outside that tolerance are
      flagged so the operator can decide whether to re-stage.
- [ ] **Safety & Rollback**: the runbook names the designated test account, the
      per-run notional cap, the deploy-config flag that enforces test mode
      (preventing live-fund execution unless explicitly disabled), the named
      approver(s) who may authorize a live check, and the documented procedure
      to revert or close any positions opened during verification.
