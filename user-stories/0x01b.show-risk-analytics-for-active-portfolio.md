# Show Risk Analytics For Active Portfolio

As a user, I want portfolio-level risk metrics beyond beta so that I can size my
book using risk numbers I would actually use in a quant context.

## Acceptance Criteria

All risk metrics on this page share a common measurement contract so they
describe the same portfolio under the same assumptions:

- `measurement_window`: a lookback expressed as either `lookback_days` or an
  explicit `start_date`/`end_date` pair. `lookback_days` is an integer in the
  inclusive range `[30, 365]` and defaults to `90`. When `start_date` and
  `end_date` are provided they take precedence over `lookback_days`,
  `start_date` must be strictly earlier than `end_date`, both must fall within
  the available history, and the resulting span must itself satisfy the
  `[30, 365]`-day bound.
- `sampling_frequency`: an enumeration; allowed values are `"daily"` and
  `"weekly"`. Default: `"daily"`.
- `confidence_levels`: array of numeric confidence levels in `(0, 1)` used by
  VaR and CVaR; allowed values are `0.90`, `0.95`, and `0.99`. Default:
  `[0.90, 0.95, 0.99]`.
- Weighting: all metrics use active position weights by default, not gross
  notional. Overrides are accepted only when the supplied weight vector matches
  the set of active positions exactly and sums to one in absolute value;
  otherwise the request is rejected with a validation error.

The portfolio view displays the active window and frequency alongside the
metrics so the reader knows the baseline.

- [ ] The portfolio view shows VaR at the configured confidence levels.
- [ ] The portfolio view shows CVaR at the configured confidence levels.
- [ ] The portfolio view shows historical drawdown for the active allocation
      over the measurement window.
- [ ] The portfolio view shows a correlation matrix across held positions
      computed over the measurement window at the configured sampling frequency.
- [ ] The portfolio view shows an effective number of bets that accounts for
      correlations.
- [ ] A Monte Carlo simulation can project portfolio returns over a chosen
      horizon, with its inputs (window, frequency, sample count) shown alongside
      the result.
- [ ] Loading and failure states for each metric are visible.
