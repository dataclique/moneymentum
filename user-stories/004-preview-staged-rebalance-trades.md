# Preview Staged Rebalance Trades

As a user, I want to be able to preview staged rebalance trades so that I can
understand what will be sent before I execute.

## Status

Completed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Editing target allocations creates staged trade rows for changed
      positions.
- [x] Each staged trade shows side, symbol, weight change, and notional change.
- [x] Removing an existing position stages the opposite side needed to close it.
- [x] Newly added positions show as staged trades.
- [x] Unchanged positions do not appear in staged changes.
- [x] The panel shows total notional before and after when the total changes.
- [x] The user can clear staged changes and return to the loaded exchange
      portfolio.
