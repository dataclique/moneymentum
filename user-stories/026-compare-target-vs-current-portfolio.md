# Compare Target vs Current Portfolio

As a user, I want to clearly see how my current allocation has drifted from my
target so that I can decide whether to rebalance and understand what will happen
when I do.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The portfolio surface labels target and current allocations distinctly.
- [ ] Each position row shows target weight, current weight, and the delta.
- [ ] Positions whose delta is below the minimum tradable change are visibly
      marked as such. The threshold is sourced from a single config key
      (`portfolio.minTradableChange`), with documented units (percent or
      absolute), a documented default value, and a documented override rule.
      The UI rendering (e.g. `markNonTradablePositions`) and the rebalance
      logic (e.g. `calculateRebalanceDeltas`) both read this key so the UI
      and the staged trades always agree on what counts as tradable.
- [ ] When the user opens the app after a price move, the drift is visible
      without having to stage any trades.
- [ ] Clicking Rebalance reflects the previewed deltas in the staged trades.
- [ ] Loading and failure states for current portfolio data are visible.
